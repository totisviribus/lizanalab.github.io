Seong-Gyu joined IceLab and Ludvig Lizana's group in 2024. They are developing mathematical models for epigenetic clocks and DNA methylation in humans.

"I got my Ph.D. in statistical physics from Sungkyunkwan University, South Korea. My research interests are broad. During my Ph.D., I studied collective behaviors in physical, biological, and social systems. After graduation, I became as a postdoc at the Asia Pacific Center for Theoretical Physics [APCTP](https://www.apctp.org), where I studied ecological models using statistical physics methods. Later, I moved to at the Korea Institute for Advanced Study [KIAS](https://www.kias.re.kr/kias/main/main.do), to learn more about network structures and random graph ensembles.""
